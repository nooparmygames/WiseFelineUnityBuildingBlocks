# WiseFelineUnityBuildingBlocks

This repository contains a collection of actions and considerations for the unity version of the wise feline utility AI and influence maps plugin.

The code here doesn't compile without you purchasing either the Lite or Ultimate version of [our Utility AI and influence maps library for Unity](https://www.nooparmygames.com/products/wise-feline-utility-ai-for-unity/).

There are lots of actions to move agents, create/destroy objects, work with influence maps and smart objects and do lots of other things.
There are also many considerations to check object tags, search influence maps or check blackboard values.
There are more specific stuff like line of sight with target which are useful for some games but not all and there are a few movement components which can move agents either using character controllers or `NavMeshAgent`s.

You can read more about the built-in actions and considerations [here](https://www.nooparmygames.com/WF-UtilityAI-Unity/articles/BuiltinActionsAndConsiderations.html)

You can use our AI suite in lots of game genres and more info on that can be found [here](https://www.nooparmygames.com/WF-UtilityAI-Unity/articles/cookbooks/game-genres.html).
